12-Feb: Objects in javascript..

Hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown of **objects** in JavaScript:

1. **What is an Object?**  
   An object is a collection of data stored in **key-value pairs**.

2. **Creating Objects**  
   You can create objects using the **object literal** syntax or the **`new Object()`** syntax.

3. **Accessing Data**  
   You can get values from an object using **dot notation** or **bracket notation**.

4. **Modifying Data**  
   You can change or add new values to an object by assigning a new value to a key.

5. **Deleting Data**  
   You can remove a key-value pair from an object using the `delete` keyword.

6. **Methods**  
   Objects can also have functions inside them, which are called **methods**.

7. **The `this` Keyword**  
   Inside an object, `this` refers to the object itself.
